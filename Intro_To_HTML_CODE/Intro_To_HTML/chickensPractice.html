      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
      species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
      junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock
      is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans
      now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat
      and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting,
      which is still practiced in some places. The chicken domesticated for its
      meat are Broilers and for its eggs are Layers.
